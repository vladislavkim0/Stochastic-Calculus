# Stochastic-Calculus

Stochastic Calculus notebook contains various simulations that I performed when taking Stochastic Calculus class, which includes Brownian motion, various stochastic processes, martingales, Ito's calculus, Option pricing and etc.

Please note that most of the code is not optimized, maybe when I have more free time I will redo some of the functions. Until then, feel free to use it.
